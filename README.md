ACT.docx: We conducted research to determine which demographic factors lead to higher ACT scores. 
We created a survey to ask BYU students about their demographic situation and high school activities. 
Then, after collecting 256 responses, we used machine-learning models to predict their ACT scores. 
This report analyzes the results we received from the Multi-Layer Perceptron, the Decision Trees, and the K-Nearest Neighbor models.

Recommendation Report.docx: One question that many students have is how to maximize their test scores. 
Many different types of machine-learning models can be used to answer this question, each with advantages and disadvantages. 
This report describes how neural networks and decision trees work. It compares expert opinions on the models. 
And, it discusses the results of empirical research performed with an online data source.
